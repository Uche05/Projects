Objective:
The goal was to predict the rank of countries (NOCs) in various Olympic sports/events for the 2024 Olympics using a Random Forest Classifier. This was achieved by creating a dashboard using Dash and Plotly, allowing users to select a sport and view the predicted rank.

Steps Taken:
Data Preparation:

Merged datasets from Medals.xlsx, EntriesGender.xlsx, Teams.xlsx, and Athletes.xlsx.
Feature engineering included calculating the total number of medals and encoding categorical variables (NOC, Discipline, Event).
Model Training:

Trained a Random Forest Classifier using features such as the number of gold, silver, bronze medals, rank by total, number of male and female athletes, and total medals.
The model aimed to predict the rank of a country based on these features.
Dashboard Creation:

Developed a Dash application with a dropdown menu for selecting different sports/events.
Implemented a callback to update the graph and display predicted ranks based on the selected sport/event.
Included error handling and debug output for troubleshooting.
Predictions:

The model made predictions for the rank based on input features (e.g., number of medals, gender distribution of athletes).
Predictions were visualized in a bar chart, showing the predicted rank for the selected sport.
Results Interpretation:
The predictions were made based on historical and provided data, aiming to estimate the performance in terms of rank. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the key results and what they imply:

Predicted Rank:

The predicted rank is based on the combination of features such as the number of medals won, the rank by total medals, and the gender distribution of athletes.
For instance, if the predicted rank for Basketball 3x3 is 1, it suggests that the country is expected to achieve the first rank in this event.
Feature Importance:

Features like the number of gold medals, total medals, and rank by total are crucial in predicting the rank.
This indicates that historically successful countries with more gold and total medals are likely to rank higher.
Error Handling:

The dashboard included mechanisms to handle unseen labels and other potential issues, ensuring robust predictions.

Conclusion:
Predictive Power: The Random Forest model demonstrated the capability to predict ranks based on historical performance data. This can be valuable for countries and sports analysts to understand potential outcomes.
Visual Insights: The Dash dashboard provided an interactive and visual way to explore predictions across different sports/events.
Data-Driven Decisions: Such predictive models can aid in making informed decisions and strategizing for future events.
The overall approach combined data integration, machine learning, and interactive visualization to offer valuable insights into potential Olympic outcomes.
