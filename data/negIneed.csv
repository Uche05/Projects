0,  if you can’t fly first class don’t fly british airways very uncomfortable seats you can’t even get out of your seat when the person in front has their seat reclined and who doesn’t need to recline their seat you can’t pick up anything off the floor during the flight because you can’t bend to touch the floor  there isn’t enough space to if you have long legs don’t think you are going to be comfortable  as soon as the person in front of you puts their chair back your knees will be crushed terrible food terrible plane terrible airhostesses terrible flight and unfortunately i have to fly back home with them
1,    singapore to heathrow business class on an a is a premium economy plus experience from the economy class sized toilets to the badly designed coffin shaped business class pods  the experience is a substandard business class experience business class pod’s storage is a small drawer at the foot of the pod the ‘privacy’ screens are opaque plastic sheets  so you are kept awake by your neighbour as their screen lights up your pod when the seat is made into its coffin shaped bed  the cold hard plastic seat moulds are an unpleasant surprise for those that turn in their sleep you have a choice of having your neighbour step over your calfheight footrest  hopefully not brushing your feet with theirs  or having to step over your neighbours feetfootrest with the footrest down  heavenforbid you try to lever yourself into a more comfortable position as the slightest pressure causes the footrest to collapse into its floor level position if you are in the aisle seat  which is open to the aisle  kiss goodbye to any privacy as not only will you be on view to all passengers  the crew will lean you to both serve your neighbour their food and talk to your neighbour over your privacy screen
2,    i reported my damagedruined suitcase  weeks ago and im still awaiting a reply ill think twice about booking with ba again as the customer service is shocking to say the least ive followed up with british airways with at least  emails per week requesting an update but with no joy so far
6,  flight cancelled with no reason given less than  h before departure the earliest offered replacement on their terrible to use app was  days later which was unacceptable their phone lines do not work and would reject your call due to being overwhelmed even submitting a claim on their website is frustrating due to their terrible interface overall terrible company with wholly inadequate customer service
8,   while ba may have made some positive improvements to its club world product its world traveler product and catering leaves much to be desired the first meal service was very slow more than  hours to serve the meal the portions were incredibly small  the chicken dish contained maybe  pieces of chicken  pieces of broccoli and a piece of unknown food small snacks were available during the flight but the real let down was the snack before landing in vancouver it was a bizarre tasting chicken pastry wrap which didnt have much chicken and did not taste at all like a pastry it was too sweet too mushy and too salty the seats although not exactly spacious were tolerable although the aisles are very narrow and cabin crew and other passengers frequently bumped into me while walking up and down the aisles cabin crew were generally responsive to passengers request and once or twice during the flight came down the aisles with drinks however the poor level of catering made for a very frustrating trip i certainly cannot recommend ba
12,   flight delayed an hour due to bad weather around jfk however this was made up during the flight only to be delayed again by weather over lhr spending an extra hour in the americanba lounge at jfk was not ideal cold environment cold staff indifferent to the travellers needs one area was exceptionally dirty with plates on the tables and napkins strewn on the floor waited for a drink as no one to serve played a game of find the chipscrisps  which were hidden on a table in a dark corner in one of the  areas this is a crazy expensive route in business class and it feels like a rip off across all the airlines however the quality of bas business class has much improved with the introduction of the suites the privacy is a big improvement as too is the seat comfort and i managed a good hr sleep on the overnight redeye flight food service was very efficient for those that wanted it and did the trick so late at night aside from getting a decent rest on the relatively short flight the other highlight was the flight attendant unfortunately i didnt catch his name but he was superb being responsive to the few requests i made and remembered my name throughout the flight a small but very valued touch that is often missing with business class flight attendants on ba very good experience all round except the price which is reflected in my value for money rating
14,  the worst airline i’ve ever flown could not check in until my flight was open i was there  hours before flight not  days before asked if my husband could fly on the same flight he was also flying club europe but on a later flight and i could see online that there was room on the plane i was on the agent said they couldn’t change his flight at the ticket counter never heard of that this could only be done online or by calling british airways i had already tried online so asked for a telephone number to call and the british airways agent did not have a number for me to call so i looked up and called several numbers online and all i got was the office was closed on saturdays i asked for the ticket agent again explained we were going to his mother’s memorial and that and it would be nice if he could get on the same flight as i was on they still refused to help so he stayed on his flight which was leaving  hours later and then got cancelled and he had to spend the night in florence they re routed him on a flight to london via edinburgh and then they lost his suitcase you can’t make this stuff up as for my flight  ba  i got several emails and messages advising me it was delayed i decided to go to the gate at the original flight time and guess what it was boarding on time i can’t imagine the number of people who might of missed it it’s just an awful awful airline and i will never fly them again if i can possibly avoid them
17,   ba cancelled the flight from tokyo to lhr i was booked on next day flight there was another flight on the same day i went to the desk but the flight was full ba in charge offers another flight through hong kong which would have been h flight time i declined that and asked to stay on the next day flight to my dismay he cancelled the next day flight without telling me he did that i think he was annoyed that i didn’t accept the offer after he spent sometime looking for in fact i am the one who should be annoyed for cancelling my flight i ended up flying another airline with downgrading poor service and appalling behaviour you expect better from ba
18,  i strongly advise everyone to never fly british airways i know we will never do so again we had business class seats booked for an early morning flight from heathrow to sf  and then the flight was cancelled the evening before the flight we luckily checked email before we went to bed and found out it was canceled we then called ba and after waiting  minutes someone to answer the call the person who finally did said he was going to move us to a united air flight leaving an hour later from heathrow to sf the next day he told us the flight number and said he had booked us business class seats it took a long time to get it all worked out so we got just a few hours sleep that night but it looked like it was resolved then however when we got to heathrow early the next morning we found that the ba person did not complete the booking as needed and united could not give us seats they said we needed to call ba to get them to complete the change but despite numerous attempt we could not get anyone to answer the phone at ba this went on for  hours finally by the grace of god after hours of stress trying to figure out what to do we found a united ticket agent at the airport who personally called ba for us and got then to fix the problem so after being at heathrow at  am we ended up leaving for sf late that afternoon totally exhausted the united air ticket agent saved us and allows us to get home she also said these problems were common with ba 
20,   we had a premium economy return flight los angeles to london the outbound flight was cancelled with under  hours notice and we had to instead take an economy flight via dublin to london thats annoying but it happens what is really difficult to understand is bas response since i raised this as a claim once our return flight had completed as i was instructed to do it is now nearly  months and there has been no response other than one in early march with the title weve not forgotten your case and were really sorry youre still waiting for a response from us we know its been a long time since you contacted us and this isnt the service you should expect rest assured weve not forgotten your case our customer relations team are working extremely hard to respond to you as soon as possible thank you for your continued patience you can check the status of your case here please accept our most sincere apologies we look forward to speaking with you soon i called about a month ago to enquire and was told id be hearing within the week this is just extremely poor customer service in addition to the inconvenience and stress of the latecancelled flight delays and change in class of flight british airways really seems to be on the decline i have so many friends who are longtime customers like us who are having flights cancelled or delayed with little commitment to make it right i have been a member of their flying club for  years is this how you treat loyal customers ba
