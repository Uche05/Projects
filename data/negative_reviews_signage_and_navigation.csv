"✅ Trip Verified |  We booked premium economy round trip from Phoenix to Zurich via AA codeshare and operated by British Airway. On our way return flight back to Phoenix February 25th, the first leg of the BA flight 0773 between Zurich and London Heathrow was delayed departure, which cause us missed the BA 0289 connection flight between Heathrow and Phoenix. First problem is that when we dash to the terminal 5 security check point at 12:00 PM, the airplane was still at gate and will not depart until 2:25 PM if it will be on schedule, we had almost 30 min at that point, however the terminal 5 security stopped us and was told we cannot pass thru the security due to airline requirement, we later realized that flight 0289 did not leave until 3:30 PM. We were directed to the customer service to re-book the flight. When we got to BA customer service transfer counter, there was only one agent available, there were least 12 passengers waiting in the lines, we were told BA was short of staffs due to British holiday during end of February and there was a soccer championship match that Sunday, so it took us at least an hour and half to rebook the same flight next day, also it seems there are not much option at all if we want to back to Phoenix on different flight on the same day. Then, the agent who re-booked the flight told us his printer was broken and we need go to Zone 2 of terminal 5 to get the ticket and hotel voucher printed. We found Zone 2 and had our ticket and voucher in hand and assure by the agent that our luggage will be on our next day flight with us as well. We also told there was a shuttle bus around the corner to take us to the hotel, however no map or detail direction provided, it took us a while to find out that the shuttle is at back side of the terminal 5, by the time we arrived at hotel we were very tired. Next day, we arrived at airport few hours ahead our scheduled departed time 2:25 PM, I noticed my checked two bags not in the same spot based on my iPhone’s Find me feature (I had Apple Air Tag in each of my checked bags), so I checked with the gate agent, she confirmed with me that only one checked bag was associated with my flight! Luckily, the flight was delayed two hours, so my other bag made to the same flight. While on the flight, the team of young flight attendants were generally pleasant, but they missed to service me meal, I did not order any special meal, and the popular chicken dish was not available when she came to my row, so I told her any chicken dish will be ok, and she told me give her few minutes and she will bring me a different chicken dish, however she totally forgot that and only when she came back to collect the trash, I mentioned to her she forgot my chicken dish, she was surprised and acting like I was lying to her. Overall, I think my premium economy flight on BA is the worst experience in recent memory. As the British flagship carrier, they seem don't care, I emailed my sent my experience to their customer service, they responded with a standard corporate reply from one of their email templates...",   we booked premium economy round trip from phoenix to zurich via aa codeshare and operated by british airway on our way return flight back to phoenix february th the first leg of the ba flight  between zurich and london heathrow was delayed departure which cause us missed the ba  connection flight between heathrow and phoenix first problem is that when we dash to the terminal  security check point at  pm the airplane was still at gate and will not depart until  pm if it will be on schedule we had almost  min at that point however the terminal  security stopped us and was told we cannot pass thru the security due to airline requirement we later realized that flight  did not leave until  pm we were directed to the customer service to rebook the flight when we got to ba customer service transfer counter there was only one agent available there were least  passengers waiting in the lines we were told ba was short of staffs due to british holiday during end of february and there was a soccer championship match that sunday so it took us at least an hour and half to rebook the same flight next day also it seems there are not much option at all if we want to back to phoenix on different flight on the same day then the agent who rebooked the flight told us his printer was broken and we need go to zone  of terminal  to get the ticket and hotel voucher printed we found zone  and had our ticket and voucher in hand and assure by the agent that our luggage will be on our next day flight with us as well we also told there was a shuttle bus around the corner to take us to the hotel however no map or detail direction provided it took us a while to find out that the shuttle is at back side of the terminal  by the time we arrived at hotel we were very tired next day we arrived at airport few hours ahead our scheduled departed time  pm i noticed my checked two bags not in the same spot based on my iphone’s find me feature i had apple air tag in each of my checked bags so i checked with the gate agent she confirmed with me that only one checked bag was associated with my flight luckily the flight was delayed two hours so my other bag made to the same flight while on the flight the team of young flight attendants were generally pleasant but they missed to service me meal i did not order any special meal and the popular chicken dish was not available when she came to my row so i told her any chicken dish will be ok and she told me give her few minutes and she will bring me a different chicken dish however she totally forgot that and only when she came back to collect the trash i mentioned to her she forgot my chicken dish she was surprised and acting like i was lying to her overall i think my premium economy flight on ba is the worst experience in recent memory as the british flagship carrier they seem dont care i emailed my sent my experience to their customer service they responded with a standard corporate reply from one of their email templates,-0.04174744897959183,Negative,"['Customer Service', 'Staffing Levels', 'Signage and Navigation', 'Specific Service Issues']"
✅ Trip Verified |  London to Gibraltar on 25th October 2022. I booked my flight several months ahead of travel and was rather disappointed by the experience.  BA attempt to nickle and dime the customers with outrageous seat selection prices. Offering of a very small bottle of water and a nutribar as a breakfast and one gains the impression of where BA aim to be positioned at of late. The A320 has was no inflight entertainment or a route map. The staff disappeared for most of the flight. The flight was punctual but I felt cheated and under whelmed by the experience. ,   london to gibraltar on th october  i booked my flight several months ahead of travel and was rather disappointed by the experience  ba attempt to nickle and dime the customers with outrageous seat selection prices offering of a very small bottle of water and a nutribar as a breakfast and one gains the impression of where ba aim to be positioned at of late the a has was no inflight entertainment or a route map the staff disappeared for most of the flight the flight was punctual but i felt cheated and under whelmed by the experience ,-0.3125,Negative,"['Customer Service', 'Facilities', 'Signage and Navigation']"
"✅ Trip Verified |  Istanbul to London. We had to wait for ages to check into our flight after being advised to turn up 3 hrs before departure time to check in. We had to wait for 40 minutes before any check in staff turned up. Once they did, the staff were surly and rude. On the flight and there was no IFE, no free drink or snack or  a map to track the flight. The onboard crew were a bit chaotic. Serving M&S food for purchase. The flight was not delayed by too much and relatively smooth. However the BA product is now tired and slightly pathetic.
