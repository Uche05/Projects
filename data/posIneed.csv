3,    on march st i flew from berlin to são paulo with ba but encountered several issues my first flight was delayed by several hours causing me to miss my connection at london heathrow upon arriving at the airport after midnight i was given a hotel voucher however the hotel designated by ba rudely denied me checkin claiming it was fully booked i had to return to heathrow at  am and found a different hotel paying for the taxi out of my own pocket as a result of these complications i arrived in são paulo more than  hours late despite my efforts to assert my rights and seek reimbursement for the taxi bas customer service has been extremely poor their phone lines are nonfunctional emails are only answered automatically and the appropriate channels for such requests have not been responsive since the first week of march this experience has left me extremely disappointed especially considering the high standard of service i once associated with ba
4,  the worst customer experience british airways ba is effectively robbing people they are not here to help and show no compassion my partner and i fell ill and had a doctor’s note stating we couldnt fly ba said theyd hold our flight amount as a voucher valid for a year fair enough caveat to this which was not stated to us you must call them and it is not usable on holiday packages however using this voucher was a nightmare we cant use it for both our tickets because the original was longhaul and they refuse to refund half the amount bas customer service was awful and rude effectively stealing £ from us this policy must stop we feel held hostage with no solution 
5,    had to cancel my flight months in advance due to a change of schedule i was flying with american airlines and british airways selected seats and when i attempted to get a refund on the selected seats aa refunded me with no issue when ba refused despite both companies having similar policies avoid them fly with anyone else customer service is a joke taking over  weeks to respond to my email and giving me no further justification than what i was told on the phone
7,  this is a route i fly regularly used first class security and lounge all good lounge surprisingly not so busy was great to see we werent departing from the dreaded a bus gate and the flight was on time boarded and ready to go on time and then six passengers were a no show a  minute delay to offload the bags and depart longer than the actual flight itself there has to be a better process for fast tracking this hence finally arrived in paris  mins late on the plus side the cabin crew were great and even had a personal welcome from the inflight manager which happens less and less these days
9,  british airways new club suite is a marked improvement from their older club world seats the new club suite offers a fair amount of privacy especially with the screen door closed and includes direct aisle access when fully reclined the seat converts into a fairly spacious bed although i found the surface on the side a bit hard and uncomfortable to sleep on the catering on board was fairly good and tasty  the appetizers and the main course were generally well cooked although the cabin crew were very slow with the meal service it took almost  hours after departure from vancouver for the meal service to be completed prior to arrival a light breakfast was served which contained a croissant a small egg and bacon sandwich and a mango puree bas catering on this flight was generally good unfortunately upon arrival at heathrow passengers had to wait over  minutes for checked baggage to arrive no explanation was given and not a single member of ground staff came to assist passengers or provide any information about when checked baggage would arrive this was a very frustrating end to what was otherwise a fairly enjoyable trip in club world and left a very poor last impression of ba
10,   four very pleasant on time flights with friendly helpful staff the guy on the lhrsfo leg was exceptional and i regret that i have forgotten his name only negative was the food on the sfolhr leg the advertised filet steak was more akin to stewing steak and was inedible sadly this is not the only occasion i have food on usuk flights to be sub standard otherwise happy to recommend ba
11,    we travel extensively over  years and tend to use ba on our regular trips where possible and in recent years we have had overall good service from them however more recently we have experienced flight delays operational issues flight cancellations poor checkin experiences etc on our last two recent trips one to zurich and another to iceland they had cancelled our return flight an hour or so prior to the scheduled departure time despite the flight showing as on time and no problems being reported we have just returned from iceland and our experience was one of the worst we have ever had with ba again our flight was just cancelled due to operational reasons but what made matters worse on this occasion was the flight was quite early at am we went to bed at around pm night before checked the flight and it showed as being on time with again no issues being reported so we went to sleep fairly rest assured the the flight would be fine we woke up at am and then discovered our flight had been cancelled without any warning we were then left with virtually no other return flight options for that day it soon got worse as the earliest flight option then being offered by ba was  days later we opted to choose tuesday with ba as we were left with no other option if we hadnt acted quickly the tuesday availability was sure to sell out leaving us with a return option of wednesday onwards having experienced the same problem with ba in zurich back in december we were lucky on this occasion as ba offered several flights back on the same day in zurich but this wasnt the case with iceland we were then left in a right predicament as hotel availability in iceland was very limited to non existent given the very short notice of our cancelled flight our hotel was fully booked and our hire car had to be returned to the airport from a logistical point of view this was a complete nightmare having to then rebook another hire car and to find alternative hotels we then decided to search for any indirect flights online to get us back to the uk sooner with another airline and after a good half hour of searching we came across an indirect flight into gatwick with norwegian air but it went via oslo and a total journey time of  hours this was not ideal as our car was in heathrow assessing our options which were virtually none we had no guarantees that the flight with ba on tuesday would also have proceeded on time and checking with norwegian air both flights were on time and looked promising so we decided to get these booked at an additional expense of £ if we had stayed in iceland we would have also incurred additional cost to then fight back with ba or the insurance company our priority was to return home asap as we had important work and personal commitments on the monday so we had to return asap we eventually flew back fine with norwegian air and the service we received was far superior to that of ba the boarding process was slick on both flights compared to a complete shambles with ba norwegian air offered a full food trolley service with soft drinks teas and also a range of alcoholic drinks compare this to just the water and snack bar on ba both flights were on time and we eventually landed in gatwick shortly after our expected arrival time we got back very late home after having to then book a hire car at gatwick and in the morning we contacted ba to cancel our alternative tuesday flight 
13,   a very full flight made premium economy feel a little less premium than you should expect for the price however the smaller cabin configuration and slightly roomier seating made the journey relaxing enough catering was pretty good and the inflight service was efficient and friendly arrived on time and no delays with baggage delivery no complaints as pe served its function for the relatively short hr flight
15,   i am surprised to be able to give a favourable review of the flight european business class is typically x seating with the middle seat on each group of three left empty leg room is never generous and ba is at the bottom of the generous barrel in this respect however on this occasion at least and as the flight is one hour that was not an issue cabin crew were great very professional and efficient cabin was clean and aircraft seemed pretty up to date i was surprised to find that business class was served an afternoon tea complete with champagne much nicer than the poor prosecco in the lounge we had three small sandwiches chocolate cake and a choice of plain or fruit scone strawberry jam and clotted cream on the side for those who wanted them it all tasted great i didnt try the chocolate cake and there was just about enough time to eat it before landing the crew worked very hard to complete service in time so well done them
16,   flew british airways on ba  london heathrow to amsterdam i was able to check in at the ba first class check in area in terminal  and this is very fast and efficient the lounge was quite busy however i was able to find space the food snacks and drinks available was excellent as was the overall service i also like the ba first class check in area as the security clearance is fast boarding was a little chaotic however we boarded on time and the take off runway was close to the departing gate therefore no delays the flight itself was quite good as was the cabin crew and the meal service
