✅ Trip Verified |  We started our day with BA in Prague. The flight actually left on time! I came to find out that’s very unusual. We purchased business class seats. As you can see from the picture they hardly were business class. All they did was block off the middle seat in the first few rows and called it business class. Horrible flight. In addition I had a really rude rude check in clerk basically yell at me when I excused myself and asked if she could give a little bit of priority to the many business class passengers who weren’t being served. Then we got to Heathrow and the real fun began. We had a 4 hour delay. They gave us about 5 different excuses for the delay. I had a few employees walk away while I was asking them questions. They were very rude. At one point there were no employees left. And from the announcements it seems virtually every BA flight was delayed. And there were no weather issues. There was no place to comfortably store items in business class. I’ve never experienced that before. Not even a cup holder for my bottle of water. The seat controls didn’t work well. You had to keep pushing the buttons to get them to do anything. The power outlet didn’t work. There was no internet the entire flight. The overhead luggage bin was too heavy. I almost got a hernia having to close it. This is a horrible airline. I’ll never fly with them again. If I could give zero stars I would.,   we started our day with ba in prague the flight actually left on time i came to find out that’s very unusual we purchased business class seats as you can see from the picture they hardly were business class all they did was block off the middle seat in the first few rows and called it business class horrible flight in addition i had a really rude rude check in clerk basically yell at me when i excused myself and asked if she could give a little bit of priority to the many business class passengers who weren’t being served then we got to heathrow and the real fun began we had a  hour delay they gave us about  different excuses for the delay i had a few employees walk away while i was asking them questions they were very rude at one point there were no employees left and from the announcements it seems virtually every ba flight was delayed and there were no weather issues there was no place to comfortably store items in business class i’ve never experienced that before not even a cup holder for my bottle of water the seat controls didn’t work well you had to keep pushing the buttons to get them to do anything the power outlet didn’t work there was no internet the entire flight the overhead luggage bin was too heavy i almost got a hernia having to close it this is a horrible airline i’ll never fly with them again if i could give zero stars i would,-0.13678030303030303,Negative,"['Customer Service', 'Facilities', 'Staffing Levels', 'Technology', 'Specific Service Issues']"
"✅ Trip Verified | Definitely not recommended, especially for business class. The seats are ridiculous and small, the food is mediocre if that, and good luck with the internet even if you pay for full internet for the entire flight. The service however has been great. My attendant saved me from crying. I don’t know who designed this aircraft but in this expensive business class, in order to move out of you middle seat to go to the bathroom you must rudely climb over the person’s legs sitting in the aisle seat. Your seat is like an enclosed tiny cubicle with no storage space. I’ve unfortunately traveled British Airways business class at least 4 times within the last 4 months. Never again unless there is no other choice. By the way, the business class lounge south at Heathrow is a cattle pen.",  definitely not recommended especially for business class the seats are ridiculous and small the food is mediocre if that and good luck with the internet even if you pay for full internet for the entire flight the service however has been great my attendant saved me from crying i don’t know who designed this aircraft but in this expensive business class in order to move out of you middle seat to go to the bathroom you must rudely climb over the person’s legs sitting in the aisle seat your seat is like an enclosed tiny cubicle with no storage space i’ve unfortunately traveled british airways business class at least  times within the last  months never again unless there is no other choice by the way the business class lounge south at heathrow is a cattle pen,-0.03854166666666666,Negative,"['Customer Service', 'Facilities', 'Technology', 'Specific Service Issues']"
"Not Verified |  The worst budget airline I’ve ever used! Far worse than Ryanair and I refuse to fly with them even though they’re basically free. BA charge about 10x as much as other budgets but have the worst service. Spent an hour checking in because their outdated computers crashed. They left us sat on the plane for over 2 hours because they couldn’t connect to the internet, then left 50% of our luggage behind because they would have had to refund everyone’s flights if they waited another 10 mins for the other luggage trolleys to arrive. It took three days to return it and cost us £100s. Then on return I’ve now been sat here nearly two hours and there’s no sign of our luggage again. I don’t know how a company can be this incompetent but I’ll be pursuing for compensation. I have some free flights from Amex but I won’t be using them because it’s not worth going through this again.",   the worst budget airline i’ve ever used far worse than ryanair and i refuse to fly with them even though they’re basically free ba charge about x as much as other budgets but have the worst service spent an hour checking in because their outdated computers crashed they left us sat on the plane for over  hours because they couldn’t connect to the internet then left  of our luggage behind because they would have had to refund everyone’s flights if they waited another  mins for the other luggage trolleys to arrive it took three days to return it and cost us £s then on return i’ve now been sat here nearly two hours and there’s no sign of our luggage again i don’t know how a company can be this incompetent but i’ll be pursuing for compensation i have some free flights from amex but i won’t be using them because it’s not worth going through this again,-0.13235294117647062,Negative,"['Staffing Levels', 'Technology', 'Specific Service Issues']"
"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Cape Town. Gone are the days in which British Airways was a great airline. Weird seat configuration, service that needs training, horrible food and no internet in business class are  basic services offered by most of the airlines but not by BA.",   london to cape town gone are the days in which british airways was a great airline weird seat configuration service that needs training horrible food and no internet in business class are  basic services offered by most of the airlines but not by ba,-0.033333333333333326,Negative,"['Facilities', 'Staffing Levels', 'Technology', 'Specific Service Issues']"
✅ Trip Verified |  Gatwick to Cancun. Flight was late. My food was bad and it was not possible to change. I paid for the internet which did not work for me most of the time. Was advised to report but no instructions to where or how.,   gatwick to cancun flight was late my food was bad and it was not possible to change i paid for the internet which did not work for me most of the time was advised to report but no instructions to where or how,-0.12499999999999994,Negative,['Technology']
