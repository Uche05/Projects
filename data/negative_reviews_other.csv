✅ Trip Verified | It is almost 11pm we were supposed to take off at 19.20 we are still sitting on the plane at the airport. The worst part is not the technical issue that has kept us grounded but the fact we have only been offered half a glass of water the entire time we have been on board.

"Not Verified |  Beware! BA don't provide any refund due to a very serious medical reason. My father was diagnosed with a severe heart defect a couple of weeks before his flight date and BA refused to give any refund as this was not a good enough reason!! We sent them a medical note from his doctor saying he is unfit to travel due to potential heart failure and needs to have heart surgery as soon as possible, and the operator totally dismissed it. They said only thing they can do is change the travel date within a year. Heart surgery recovery takes months and it's highly unlikely that he will be able to travel within the year, meaning he would lose his ticket and money! They said they can't do anything to help, not even change the name on the ticket so someone else can use the tickets! The most ridiculous thing I've heard!",   beware ba dont provide any refund due to a very serious medical reason my father was diagnosed with a severe heart defect a couple of weeks before his flight date and ba refused to give any refund as this was not a good enough reason we sent them a medical note from his doctor saying he is unfit to travel due to potential heart failure and needs to have heart surgery as soon as possible and the operator totally dismissed it they said only thing they can do is change the travel date within a year heart surgery recovery takes months and its highly unlikely that he will be able to travel within the year meaning he would lose his ticket and money they said they cant do anything to help not even change the name on the ticket so someone else can use the tickets the most ridiculous thing ive heard,-0.07395833333333332,Negative,['Other']
"✅ Trip Verified |  Having not flown with BA for a few years, I read some of the reviews in preparation, needless to say I boarded this flight with low expectations. I was pleasantly surprised as the flight was ok. We left LHR a few minutes early and arrived at JNB ahead of schedule. Cabin crew, although not as good as some carriers were attentive and professional. Onboard catering was a disappointment as if you were unlucky to miss out on the chicken you were given a very sloppy pasta. On board entertainment has never been BA's strong point and sadly that hasn't changed. Unfortunately BA is not the prestigious carrier it once was but its not as bad (from my experience) as some reviews suggest.",   having not flown with ba for a few years i read some of the reviews in preparation needless to say i boarded this flight with low expectations i was pleasantly surprised as the flight was ok we left lhr a few minutes early and arrived at jnb ahead of schedule cabin crew although not as good as some carriers were attentive and professional onboard catering was a disappointment as if you were unlucky to miss out on the chicken you were given a very sloppy pasta on board entertainment has never been bas strong point and sadly that hasnt changed unfortunately ba is not the prestigious carrier it once was but its not as bad from my experience as some reviews suggest,-0.0699074074074074,Negative,['Other']
"Not Verified |  My initial flight was cancelled 8 hours prior the flight. Then I was automatically rescheduled for next day. Next day, the flight was delayed leaving Hamburg and missed my connecting flight to Las Vegas. Me and several other passengers spent the night in London. British Airways provided us with vouchers but the transfer bus dropped us at the wrong hotel (closest to our hotel) and told us that we can walk there if we want to. As a result, I lost two nights hotel reservations that I made in las Vegas. I opened a claim and provided all receipts to British Airways to get refund of my hotel reservations, but over 5 weeks now, not a single feedback from British Airways.

✅ Trip Verified |  A serious medical problem appeared while I was onboard. I informed the crew and they helped me out. Unfortunately I was in transit but travelling further became too difficult because of how unwell I became. Also I could not find my way back home in my condition.

"Not Verified |  BA cancelled my flight home to Heathrow on Dec 19th. On the face of it, that was sensible as the weather in Iceland was appalling. However, what was not acceptable was that the flight was cancelled only 4 hours before take off time by which time I was already struggling through dreadful driving conditions to get to the airport. I got nowhere near before the conditions became too bad. If they had taken advice they would have spared everyone the need to try and travel on roads that all ended up closed. I am now booked onto the flight on the 21st and downgraded for my sins. Having checked today, as I type they have not cancelled the flight on the 20th despite the road to Keflavík being closed!

"✅ Trip Verified |  Having been promised help to find a hotel room after an outgoing flight from Heathrow was running very late and my hotel would be closed, I boarded the plane on this basis. I was subsequently dumped at Barcelona airport at 0038 to sleep the night on the floor. There was no help at there to find a hotel. I have MS and can't walk without help, BA did nothing, their partners Iberia did nothing. At about 3 am some kind people helped me to an more secure area and toilet and got me some sandwiches. I lost my holiday, my hotel booking, and my music course. BA insist it's not their fault it's the hotels for closing. I would not have got on the plane had I known. I found out I could go to arbitration. BA now say they will withdraw the 'offer' of expenses if I do. Their policy of refusing all compensation for what would have been a dreadful experience for any passenger, is bad enough. For someone who is not mobile, it seems to have ditched the specific responsibilities of Duty of Care and towards Disabled Passengers.

✅ Trip Verified |  Another dreadful mediocre experience with BA to Malaga. This time boarding was by bus and to a remote stand with no Aircon. Then on flight the the Wi-Fi was erratic and guests couldn’t order food or drinks. Then the card payment system didn’t work so we gave up on ordering.
